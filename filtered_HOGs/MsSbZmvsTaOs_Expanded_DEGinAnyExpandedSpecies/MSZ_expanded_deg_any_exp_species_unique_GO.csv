Corepressors often act by altering chromatin structure and modifications. For example, one class of transcription corepressors modifies chromatin structure through covalent modification of histones. A second class remodels the conformation of chromatin in an ATP-dependent fashion. A third class modulates interactions of DNA-bound DNA-binding transcription factors with other transcription coregulators."
